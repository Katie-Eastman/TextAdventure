# Text Adventure

# Overview:
This is a simple, text-based, console program written in Java. 
It is a 'choose-your-own-adventure' style short story.
The player will be prompted to give input to create their character, as well as make choices as the game continues. 
As it is now, there are a few different ways that the player can die, a combat system, and an open-ended 'to be continued' ending. 

# Installation/Run Instructions:
This program runs as a console program, and so the user must have Java installed in order to use it.
Once Java is installed, simply running the Main.java file from this Repo should initiate the game in the console. 

# Character Randomizer:
Included in this Repo is another program named CharacterRandomizer.java. 
This is an addendum program meant to help players randomize stats for a new character before playing the main game, if they so choose. 
CharacterRandomizer is a simple GUI program that requires both Java and JavaFX to run...both of these must be installed for the program to function properly. 

# Future Improvements:
There are a great many things that I would like to update and change to improve this Repo in the future with more time.
First and foremost, I would like to completely overhaul Main.java so that the entire project could use JavaFX and run as a GUI program, rather than just having an addendum GUI program.
Additionally, I would like to expand upon the story, as well as add more customizability to the player character as well as to encounters. 
A dialogue system would also be neat to implement, if the story expanded enough to warrant such a thing.
